## Overview

My attempt on solving a frontendmentor challenge with HTML and CSS. Added a few extra cards to practice flexbox.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page, viewable both on desktop and mobile.

## My process
1. Build a card layout in HTML
2. Style with Vanilla CSS
3. Duplicate cards 
4. Adjust layout with Flexbox

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After a long break of not touching any code or markup I wanted to practice. I have brushed up on CSS knowledge, how selectors work, parent and child relationships and many other quirks of CSS that I have forgotten about. Made a layout with flexbox and making the piece usable on a mobile device.
